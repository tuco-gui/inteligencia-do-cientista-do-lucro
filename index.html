  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <p>
    This GPT (“the Assistant”) was designed to assist users with technical, automation, and software development tasks.
    It does not intentionally collect, store, or share personal information outside the scope of normal conversation.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Handling</h2>
  <p>Messages entered by the user are processed only for the purpose of generating helpful responses.</p>
  <p>No personal data is intentionally collected, stored, or sold to third parties.</p>
  <p>The Assistant does not use external databases or APIs to track or identify users.</p>

  <h2>Conversations and Storage</h2>
  <p>Chat history is processed by OpenAI systems as part of normal GPT operation.</p>
  <p>
    If this GPT has custom knowledge files (e.g., <code>Ultra_Knowledge_Pack.md</code>), those files are static and do not record user data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Uploaded or shared content is processed only temporarily to generate the current response and is not used for any unrelated purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>External Actions and APIs</h2>
  <p>
    This GPT can query public APIs (n8n, Supabase, Base44, Evolution API) only when explicitly triggered by the user.
  </p>
  <p>These calls are read-only and limited to publicly available documentation endpoints.</p>
  <p>No private credentials or authentication tokens are used.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>The GPT follows OpenAI’s security standards for API requests and responses.</p>
  <p>It does not intentionally store API keys, passwords, or tokens.</p>
  <p>
    Users should avoid sharing sensitive information such as credentials, personal data, or confidential code.
  </p>

  <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    Users are responsible for verifying any code, configuration, or automation provided by the Assistant before deploying it.
  </p>
  <p>The Assistant may provide example API calls or workflows for educational purposes only.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>
    References to third-party sites (e.g., docs.n8n.io, supabase.com/docs, doc.evolution-api.com, docs.base44.com)
    are provided for educational purposes.
  </p>
  <p>These sites have their own privacy policies. Users should review them separately.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
